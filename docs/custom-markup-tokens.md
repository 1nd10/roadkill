# Custom markup tokens
You can add your own markup tokens that are replaced by editing the `~/App_Data/customvariables.xml` file. This file uses regular expressions to search and replace tokens for example `(youtube:someid)` is replaced with the HTML to display a youtube video.

You will need to restart the application by making a web.config change for any new tokens to show.
